# Your first session in <span class="y">EDGEkit</span>

EDGEkit is [installed](install.html) and open. This page shows where things are, gets each tool ready, and ends with something to try.

## The window

If you have used VS Code, you know this window. If not, four parts are enough to start:

| Part | Where | What it's for |
|---|---|---|
| **The activity bar** | The strip of icons down the left edge | One icon per tool. Click one to open that tool's panel |
| **The side bar** | Beside the activity bar | The panel of the tool you clicked: its lists and buttons |
| **The editor** | The large middle area | Whatever you open: a file, a material, a quest, the Welcome page |
| **The command palette** | Press **Ctrl+Shift+P** | A search box for every command. Type a tool's name, such as `EDGEdeck`, to see what it can do |

{% include shot.html caption="The EDGEkit window" shows="The EDGEkit window with the activity bar on the left, each EDGE tool's icon labelled: REDcode, EDGEdeck, EDGEmat, EDGEwave, REDsave, EDGEquest and EDGEhack, with REDcode's side bar open beside it." %}

## Where each tool lives

Each built-in tool has its own icon in the activity bar. Hover over an icon to see its name.

| Icon | Opens | Start with |
|---|---|---|
| **REDcode** | Your project, the game's files (Game Assets), the TweakDB and the game's texts | [REDcode](../redcode/) |
| **EDGEdeck** | **Mods**: your mod library | [EDGEdeck](../edgedeck/) |
| **EDGEmat** | The Desk, Game Materials and Find | [EDGEmat](../edgemat/) |
| **EDGEwave** | Sounds and Game Assets | [EDGEwave](../edgewave/) |
| **EDGEquest** | Project Quests and Game Quests | [EDGEquest](../edgequest/) |
| **EDGEhack** | The Desk, the Library and Quickhacks | [EDGEhack](../edgehack/) |
| **REDsave** | **Saves**: your save games | [REDsave's docs](https://edgemodders.github.io/REDsave/) |

Claude Code adds its own icon once it is installed.

## Set up the tools

The tools are installed, but two of them need a first step before anything else works, because every tool reads the game through them.

1. **Tell REDcode where the game is.** On the Welcome page, open the step **Point REDcode at the game** and press **Set Game Folder**. Pick your Cyberpunk 2077 folder. You do this once.
2. **Get REDbridge.** REDbridge is the engine that reads the game's files. Press **Ctrl+Shift+P**, type `REDcode: Install REDbridge` and press Enter. REDcode downloads it. More in [Install and set up REDcode](../redcode/install.html).
3. **Set up EDGEdeck**, if you want to manage mods. Click the EDGEdeck icon and follow its **Set up** steps. See [Install and set up EDGEdeck](../edgedeck/install.html).

The other tools set themselves up the first time you use them:

| Tool | Its first step |
|---|---|
| EDGEmat | Builds its list of the game's materials once. See [Install EDGEmat](../edgemat/install.html) |
| EDGEwave | Needs a REDcode project open. See [Install and use EDGEwave](../edgewave/try-it.html) |
| EDGEquest | See [Install and set up EDGEquest](../edgequest/install.html) |
| EDGEhack | Reads the game's quickhacks the first time its view opens, about 15 seconds. See [Install and set up EDGEhack](../edgehack/install.html) |

## The Welcome walkthrough

The Welcome page lists EDGEkit's own steps. Each has a button that does the step for you. To open it again later, use **Help**, then **Welcome**.

| Step | What its button does |
|---|---|
| **Sign in with GitHub** | Optional. For sharing mod projects on GitHub |
| **The EDGE tools** | Says what is built in, and opens the list of EDGE extensions |
| **Set up Claude Code for EDGE** | Installs EDGEchat into Claude Code. See [below](#claude-code-and-edgechat) |
| **Point REDcode at the game** | Sets the game folder |
| **Get mods from Nexus Mods** | Sends Nexus Mods' **Mod manager download** button to EDGEdeck. Press it again if Vortex took the button back |
| **The REDnode HUD theme** | Lets you pick another colour theme |
| **Open a mod** | Opens a mod's folder, or copies one from GitHub |
| **Learn more** | Links to the docs |

## Claude Code and EDGEchat

Claude Code is Anthropic's AI assistant: a chat panel in EDGEkit that can read files and do work for you. On its own it knows nothing about Cyberpunk modding. **EDGEchat** is the free add-on that teaches it, and connects it to the EDGE tools so it can read the game's files, manage your mods and change materials. With both, you can ask for a mod in plain words: see [EDGEchat](../edgechat/).

**What it needs.** Claude Code needs a Claude account whose plan includes Claude Code. That is Anthropic's, and paid for separately from EDGE. Sign in when Claude Code asks. See [Claude Code's setup](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/setup).

**Setting it up.** EDGEkit asks "Set up Claude Code for EDGE?" once, after Claude Code installs. If you skipped it, run it now: press **Ctrl+Shift+P** and type `EDGEkit: Set Up Claude Code for EDGE`, or use the Welcome page's step.

1. Press **Set Up**. Claude Code opens its plugin dialog, showing EDGEchat.
2. Install it there.
3. EDGEkit opens a new Claude Code chat with `/edge:setup` already typed in its box. Press **Enter** to send it.
4. Claude checks its connections to the EDGE tools and lists what is ready and what is missing, with the next step for each. [EDGEchat's Install and connect](../edgechat/install.html) explains each line of that answer.

{% include shot.html caption="Set up Claude Code for EDGE" shows="EDGEkit's one-time question Set up Claude Code for EDGE?, with its Set Up and No, Thanks buttons, and Claude Code's plugin dialog open on EDGEchat." %}

This passed the developer's test on a fresh install of EDGEkit 1.140.2.
