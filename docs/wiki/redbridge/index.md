# RED<span class="y">bridge</span>

REDbridge is a small helper program that reads and writes Cyberpunk 2077's game files for the other EDGE tools. It has no window. You don't open it or use it yourself: the tools download it with one click and start it when they need it. Inside, it uses the same code as [WolvenKit](https://github.com/WolvenKit/WolvenKit), the community's main modding tool.

**New here?** You most likely don't need to read further. When a tool needs REDbridge, it offers a **Get REDbridge** or **Install REDbridge** button: press it. Come back if a tool says REDbridge is missing or too old: [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.html).

## What it's for

Cyberpunk 2077 keeps its models, textures, sounds and game data packed inside `.archive` files, in formats only specialist tools can read. WolvenKit is the community's tool for that, built over years. REDbridge puts WolvenKit's reading and writing code in a program the EDGE tools can call, so each tool doesn't have to learn the game's formats again.

You notice REDbridge through what the other tools can do with it:

| Toolkit | What REDbridge lets it do |
|---|---|
| [EDGEdeck](../edgedeck/) | See [conflicts inside mod archives](../edgedeck/conflicts.html), and list what is in an archive |
| [REDcode](../redcode/) | Browse and open the game's files, view models and textures, look up items and texts, and pack your mod |
| [EDGEbuilder](../edgebuilder/) | List the game's models, and your mods', with their sizes and looks. [Bake a scene](../edgebuilder/baking.html) into a mod |
| [EDGEmat](../edgemat/), [EDGEwave](../edgewave/), [EDGEquest](../edgequest/) | Read and write the game's materials, sounds and spoken lines |
| [REDnode](../rednode/) | Mods you allow can read the game's files while you play |
| AI assistants | Claude and other assistants reach the same abilities through REDcode's connection for assistants. [EDGEchat](../edgechat/) sets it up for you |

REDbridge can also read what the game itself placed in the world. EDGEbuilder will use that for a world map and an inspector, which are planned.

## Do I need to do anything?

Usually one click, once.

| You use | What to do |
|---|---|
| EDGEdeck | Press **Get REDbridge** in the Set up group |
| REDcode | Press **Install REDbridge** when REDcode asks at its first start |
| Only tools in the game, such as EDGEbuilder | Press **Get REDbridge** in REDnode's Mod Manager. If EDGEdeck or REDcode already fetched a copy, REDnode uses that one and you do nothing |

REDbridge needs Microsoft's free .NET 10 runtime. EDGEdeck and REDnode install it for you, and REDcode offers to. After that, each tool tells you when a newer REDbridge is out.

[Install and update](install.html) has the details: where each copy goes, which version each tool needs, and installing by hand.

## Is it safe?

- **It runs only on your PC**, and only while a tool needs it. The tool that started it stops it again.
- **Only the tool that started it can talk to it.** REDbridge opens no network port. It takes requests from the program that launched it and from nothing else.
- **In the game, you decide.** A REDnode mod can use REDbridge only after you switch on **Allowed** for it in the Mod Manager, because REDbridge can read and write files. See [Permissions](../rednode/mod-manager.html#permissions).
- **Its source is public.** REDbridge is open source, under the GPL-3.0 licence, as WolvenKit is.

## Status

**Released.** The latest is REDbridge 0.12.1 (2026-11-08), for game 2.5, built with WolvenKit 10.0.0-beta.1. It is on [GitHub](https://github.com/Edgemodders/REDbridge/releases), and the tools fetch it from there.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Runs on** | Windows, 64-bit, with the .NET 10 runtime |
| **Game version** | 2.5. On a game kept at 2.31, see [Game 2.31](install.html#game-231) |
| **Used by** | EDGEdeck, REDcode, REDnode, EDGEbuilder, EDGEmat, EDGEwave, EDGEquest and EDGEchat |
| **In the game** | The baking it does for EDGEbuilder passed its tests in game 2.5: baked objects are in the world, solid, and drawn at the distance the scene sets |
| **Planned** | Linux. Not scheduled |

What changed in each release is in the [changelog](https://github.com/Edgemodders/REDbridge/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

## For tool makers

REDbridge answers requests in JSON from the program that starts it. If you are making a tool of your own, the reference is on REDbridge's side, not here:

| You want | Read |
|---|---|
| Every method, by group, and how a program talks to REDbridge | The [README](https://github.com/Edgemodders/REDbridge#readme) |
| Each method's parameters, with examples: reading the world's sectors (`sector.find`, `sector.nodes`), sizes and looks (`mesh.info`), and baking with solid objects (`sector.build`) | The [changelog](https://github.com/Edgemodders/REDbridge/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) |
| Using REDbridge from a REDnode mod | REDnode's [overlay apps guide](https://edgemodders.github.io/REDnode/overlay-apps.html#the-games-files-through-redbridge) |
| Using it from an AI assistant | [REDcode's MCP server](https://edgemodders.github.io/REDcode/mcp.html) |
| Building REDbridge from source | The [REDbridge docs](https://edgemodders.github.io/REDbridge/) |

For what baking does from a user's side, such as which objects end up solid, see EDGEbuilder's [Baking](../edgebuilder/baking.html) page.

REDbridge is GPL-3.0 because it includes WolvenKit's GPL-3.0 code. The tools that use it keep their own MIT licence, and talk to it only as a separate program.
