# Browsing and <span class="y">dropping</span>

Everything starts on the **Assets** tab: find a thing in the game's own files, pick it, and drop it into the world.

| On this page | |
|---|---|
| [What you can place](#what-you-can-place) | Meshes, entities and people |
| [Search](#search) | The search box, the two rows of tabs, the tags |
| [Your mods and your project](#your-mods-and-your-project) | Models that aren't the game's own |
| [Pick an asset](#pick-an-asset) | The Picked panel, sizes and appearances |
| [Drop it](#drop-it) | Drop where I look, and Drop at click |
| [People (NPCs)](#people-npcs) | Placing the game's people |
| [Files from your project](#files-from-your-project) | Seeing a model you are still making |
| [After the drop](#after-the-drop) | Where the object goes next |
| [Try it](#try-it-drop-something-from-one-of-your-mods) | Drop something from one of your mods |

## What you can place

| Kind | What it is | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Mesh** (`.mesh`) | A 3D model on its own: a shape with its surface, and nothing else. A mesh can be scaled | A cargo crate, a bench, a wall panel |
| **Entity** (`.ent`) | A ready-made game object, built from one or more meshes, sometimes with lights, doors or other working parts. Its size is fixed by its own file, so it can't be scaled | A vending machine, an ATM |
| **NPC** | One of the game's people: crowd people and story characters alike. See [People (NPCs)](#people-npcs) | Judy, a rich citizen |

An **asset** is any one of these. Lights, decals, effects and sounds are planned, not built.

EDGEbuilder doesn't come with a list of game files. The first time it starts, it asks [REDbridge](../redbridge/) to read your game and builds its own list: about 31,500 meshes and entities, and about 6,600 people. That takes a few seconds, once. The list is saved, and is built again when the game is updated. **Rebuild asset index** on the Settings tab builds it again by hand.

## Search

1. Open the **Assets** tab.
2. Type what you are looking for, for example `cargo crate`, `bench` or `vending`. You don't need to click the search box first: typing anywhere on the Assets tab goes into it.
3. Narrow the list with the two rows of tabs under the box:

| Tabs | Show |
|---|---|
| **All**, **Meshes**, **Entities**, **NPCs** | Every kind, or only one. **All** includes people |
| **Everywhere**, **Game**, **Mods**, **Project** | Everything, the game's own files, your installed mods, or the project open in REDcode |

On **Mods** and **Project** the list is filled straight away. You don't need to type anything. Typing a mod's name finds that mod's files. People are the game's own, so they show under **Everywhere** and **Game** only.

Each result shows a name, with tags at the right:

| Tag | Means |
|---|---|
| **mesh**, **entity** or **NPC** | The kind |
| **PL** | An asset from Phantom Liberty |
| A mod's name | The file comes from that mod |
| **project** and a name | The file comes from the REDcode project of that name |
| **changes a game file** | A mod's file that replaces one of the game's own, so dropping it shows the mod's version |

Hover a result for its full path, and for a mod's file, the archive it is in.

The count above the list says how many matched: `1 mesh found`, `4 entities found`, `0 assets found for "chair"`. The list stops at 120 results, and the count then shows **120+**. A longer, more exact search works better than scrolling.

{% include shot.html src="/assets/shots/edgebuilder/browsing-search.webp" caption="Searching the asset index" shows="The Assets tab with cargo crate typed in the search box, the Meshes and Everywhere tabs selected, a list of results with their tags, the count above the list and the Mods and Project line." %}

## Your mods and your project

EDGEbuilder also lists the meshes and entities in:

- **your installed mods**: the archives in the game's `archive\pc\mod` folder, and in REDmod's `mods\<name>\archives`. A mod in [EDGEdeck](../edgedeck/) is listed once you have deployed it;
- **the project open in [REDcode](../redcode/)**: its files under `source\archive`.

A line on the Assets tab says what was found, for example `Mods: 17 in 5 archives  |  Project MyMod: 3`, or **No REDcode project open**.

Mod archives are read once, and again only when one changes. A file you save into the project shows up within a few seconds.

A scene that uses a mod's file needs that mod. The Scene tab says so: **This scene needs: EvilClown**. Anyone you give the scene or its bake to needs the same mod. See [Sharing a baked scene](baking.html#sharing-a-baked-scene).

## Pick an asset

Click a result. The **Picked** panel at the bottom of the tab shows:

- the asset's path in the game's files;
- its size in metres, along X, Y and Z. Z is up, so the third number is its height;
- a list of its **appearances**, when it has more than one. An appearance is a variant of the same model: other colours, labels or wear. `cargo_crate_a.mesh`, for example, has 18.

Click an appearance to use it for the next drop.

| If | Then |
|---|---|
| REDbridge isn't running | The size and appearances may be missing. You can still drop the asset |
| The asset has no size | It still drops. EDGEbuilder doesn't know its shape, so the box drawn around it when selected is a 1 m cube. Many entities are like this |

**The pin.** The Picked panel has a pin in its top right corner. Pinned, the panel stays at the bottom of the tab while the results scroll, so the Drop buttons are always in view. It starts pinned. Click the pin to let the panel scroll with the tab instead. EDGEbuilder remembers your choice. The Picked panel on the Library tab and the Selected panel on the Scene tab have the same pin.

## Drop it

Press **Drop where I look**.

| With | The asset lands |
|---|---|
| [Edit](positioning.html#the-edit-switch) on | On the first surface the camera looks at, up to 60 m away, turned to face the camera. With nothing in that range, 6 m ahead |
| Edit off (or Edit on with **Use EDGEbuilder's own camera** switched off in Settings) | About 3 m in front of V, facing V |

**Drop at click** beside it lets you choose the spot:

1. Press **Drop at click**. It switches Edit on if it's off.
2. Click a spot in the world. The asset lands on the surface you clicked, turned to face the camera.

**Esc** or a right-click cancels, and nothing is dropped.

**What you should see:** the object in the world, the **Scene** tab open with the new object selected, and a message such as **Dropped cargo_crate_a.mesh in 412 ms.** A drop takes about half a second. If it fails, nothing is added to the scene, and the message line says why.

{% include shot.html src="/assets/shots/edgebuilder/browsing-dropped.webp" caption="A dropped crate" shows="A cargo crate standing on the pavement in front of V, with the message line in the EDGEbuilder panel saying how many milliseconds the drop took." %}

## People (NPCs)

The **NPCs** tab lists the game's people, about 6,600 of them. The game keeps a list of every person it can spawn, each under a name such as `Character.Judy`. EDGEbuilder reads that list once, the first time it starts, and remembers it.

| To | Do |
|---|---|
| Find someone | Search by the name the game shows (`Judy`) or by the game's own name for them (`Character.Judy`) |
| Choose how they look | Click an appearance in the Picked panel, or leave **Any: the game picks**. EDGEbuilder keeps whichever one the person got, so they look the same next time |
| Place them | Drop them like anything else |
| Move and turn them | With the gizmo or the keys, as on [Positioning objects](positioning.html) |
| Copy, paste, group, undo | As for any object: see [Arranging a scene](arranging.html) |

What to expect from a placed person:

- They stand where you put them, hold still, and stay friendly to V. Walk into one and they may grumble, nothing more.
- While you drag, only the gizmo moves. The person steps to the new place when you let go. That is how the game moves its people.
- They always stand upright, however you turn them.
- They can't be scaled, and the settings for a bake (**Solid when baked** and **Seen from, m**) don't apply to them.
- They come back with the scene after a save loads or the game starts.

> **People are not baked.** A bake leaves them out, and the Bake tab lists which. They appear only while EDGEbuilder is running.

### Try it: stand Judy beside V

1. On the **Assets** tab, click **NPCs** and type `judy`.
2. Click a result. Leave the appearance on **Any: the game picks**.
3. Press **Drop where I look**. Judy stands about 3 m in front of V.
4. Switch **Edit** on, click her, and drag the yellow ring. Let go: she turns to face the new way.
5. Press **Delete** to send her away again, or **Ctrl+Z** to bring her back.

## Files from your project

This is for when you are making or changing a model in REDcode and want to see it in the world.

A file in your REDcode project isn't in the game until the project is packed and loaded. If you drop it before that, the message says so. If the file replaces one of the game's own files, you see the game's version for now.

To see your version:

1. Save the file in the project.
2. In REDcode, press **Pack and Play**. It packs the project and swaps it into the running game.
3. Look at the world. The previews that use the file come back by themselves, in the same place and still selected, showing the new version.

See REDcode's [Pack and Play](../redcode/pack-install.html#pack-and-play-into-the-running-game).

## After the drop

- **The object is in your scene.** Everything you drop is listed on the Scene tab. See [The Scene tab](scenes.html#the-scene-tab).
- **Put it exactly right.** See [Positioning objects](positioning.html).
- **It survives a load.** Loading a save takes previews out of the world. They come back by themselves a moment after the save is in. See [Previews and scenes](scenes.html#previews-and-scenes).

## Try it: drop something from one of your mods

1. Open the **Assets** tab and click **Mods**. The line above the list says how many models your mods have.
2. Type part of a mod's name. Its files are listed, each tagged with the mod.
3. Click **All** to see both kinds: a **mesh** (a model only) and an **entity** (a game object with its own parts, such as lights or doors).
4. Click a result. The **Picked** panel shows its size and appearances.
5. Press **Drop at click**, then click a spot on the ground. The object lands there, facing the camera.
6. Open the **Scene** tab. The object is listed, and the line above the list says **This scene needs:** and the mod's name.

No mods with models installed? Do the same on the **Game** tab with `bench` or `vending machine`.
