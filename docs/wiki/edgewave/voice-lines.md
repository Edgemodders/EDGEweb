# Voices for quests and <span class="y">mods</span>

Two features voice many lines at once. Both use [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io) with your own key, so read [Cost, privacy and your key](voices.html#cost-privacy-and-your-key) first.

## Voice a quest

[EDGEquest](../edgequest/) is EDGE's quest maker: you write a quest's story, with its dialogue, and it builds the quest. **Voice Lines** takes that quest's lines and gives each one a spoken take.

> **In the game, the lines are still subtitles only.** Voice Lines makes each take as a WAV file in your project, where you can hear and edit it. Putting those takes into the game as real dialogue needs the `.wem` format, which is not there yet ([Voice lines](into-the-game.html#voice-lines)). Voice your quest now and the takes are ready when it is.

| You need | |
|---|---|
| EDGEquest, with a quest that has lines | The lines come from its Storyboard |
| An ElevenLabs key | [Your key](voices.html#your-key). Every line voiced spends credits, and each of V's lines is voiced twice, once for each of V's voices |

**To start:**

1. In EDGEquest, open your quest on its Storyboard and click a beat's card.
2. On the beat's page, press **Voice all N lines** beside a scene's name. To voice a single line, press **Generate** on that line.
3. EDGEwave opens a tab, **Voice Lines: `<quest>`**, with those lines.

| What you should see | |
|---|---|
| The tab | The scene's lines, each with its speaker and text, all marked **no take**. V's lines have two takes each, **F** and **M** |

To come back to a quest you voiced before, run **EDGEwave: Voice Lines...** from the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`).

## The Voice Lines panel

1. **Pick the voices.** At the top, choose a voice for each speaker from your ElevenLabs account, and two for V: female V and male V. **▶** plays a voice's sample.
2. **Press Generate All.** It voices every line that has no take yet, or whose words changed since its take. **Stop** ends the run. What was made is kept.
3. **Listen.** **▶** on a take plays it.
4. **Fix what you don't like**, line by line.

| On a line | Does |
|---|---|
| **Generate**, **Regenerate** | Voices just this line, again |
| **Previous** | Swaps back to the take before, and again to the new one |
| **Use a file...** | Uses a recording of your own for this take: a WAV, MP3, OGG or FLAC file |
| **Studio** | Opens the take in EDGEwave's [editor](editing.html), to trim it or add effects. Press **Render WAV** there, and the panel plays the edited take |

| What you should see | |
|---|---|
| While it runs | The header counts the voiced lines, and the line being made says **voicing...** |
| When a line is done | It says **voiced**, with what made it and when, such as `Made with eleven_v3` |
| In EDGEquest | The Storyboard shows the same lines as voiced. Change a line's text there, and both show it as changed |

Your voice choices are remembered for the quest. The takes are in your project, in `source\raw\edgewave\voice\<quest>`: one WAV per take, named the way the game names voice files, and `voice.json`, the record of what was made from what.

{% include shot.html caption="The Voice Lines panel" shows="The Voice Lines tab for a quest: the header with the count of voiced lines, the Model menu and Generate All, the voice pickers for V's two voices and one other speaker, and three lines with their F and M takes, play buttons, and the Use a file, Studio, Regenerate and Previous buttons." %}

## How a line is spoken

By default each line is spoken as its subtitle reads. To direct it, write the line again in its **Say** box in EDGEquest, with **delivery tags** in square brackets:

```
[whispers] Here it is. [sighs] Not what I expected.
```

| Model, in the panel's header | With tags |
|---|---|
| `eleven_v3`, the default | Follows them: the line is whispered, with a sigh. The tag words are not read out |
| Any other, such as `eleven_multilingual_v2` | Speaks plainly. The tags are taken out first |

The model Voice Lines starts with is the setting `edgewave.voiceLines.model`.

## EDGEwave Voice for REDnode

**EDGEwave Voice** is a small game mod, a [REDnode](../rednode/) package. It lets other REDnode mods speak lines of text aloud while you play, in a voice you set up. It is for mods that write their words as they go, such as an AI companion. On its own it does nothing you can hear, except a test line.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Needs** | REDnode 0.36 or later in the game, and an ElevenLabs key |
| **Costs** | Each new line spends your ElevenLabs credits. Every line is kept on disk, so the same words in the same voice play again at once and for free |
| **Sounds** | On the game's **Dialogue** volume slider. It pauses in menus. There is no lip movement, and subtitles are up to the mod that speaks |

**Set it up:**

1. In VS Code, run **EDGEwave: Voices for REDnode...** from the command palette. Pick the ElevenLabs voices that mods may use. Voices EDGEwave made come first.
2. Start the game and load a save. Press **F10** and open **EDGEwave Voice** from REDnode's launcher.
3. Paste your ElevenLabs key into the window and press **Enter**. The **Copy the Key** button in step 1's message puts the key on the clipboard for this.
4. Under **Try a line**, press **Speak**.

| What you should see | |
|---|---|
| After step 1 | A message naming the voices by short names, such as `judy`. In the game folder, `red4ext\plugins\REDnode\apps\edgewave-voice`, with a `voices.json` that lists them. The first is the default |
| After step 2 | The window says "No key yet" |
| After step 3 | "Key set", and the box empties |
| After step 4 | The line, spoken, a second or two later. Press **Speak** again: it plays at once, "from the cache" |

Good to know:

- **The key is typed in the game** because a REDnode package can read only its own secrets. REDnode keeps it encrypted with your Windows account. EDGEwave can't hand it over for you.
- **Once a key is set, the window stays closed** when the game starts. To open it, load a save and switch EDGEwave Voice off and on in the launcher.
- **To rename a voice** or change the default, edit `voices.json`. Running **Voices for REDnode...** again keeps the names you have.
- **Without VS Code**, the package is also a download of its own, `edgewave-voice-<version>.zip`, on EDGEwave's [releases page](https://github.com/Edgemodders/EDGEwave/releases) and as an optional file on [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/35493). Unzip it into the game folder. The zip has no `voices.json`: the command in step 1 makes it.
- **A voice belongs to one ElevenLabs account.** A mod you share with other players needs their own key and voices.
- **A cloned game voice is a real voice actor's.** [Voice clones](voices.html#voice-clones) applies here too, and more so if the result is shared.

The cached lines are in the package's `.cache` folder, up to 200 MB. The oldest go first.

## For mod authors

A REDnode mod reaches EDGEwave Voice as a service:

```js
import { service } from 'rednode';

const voice = await service.connect('edgewave-voice');
const line = await voice.speak('Choom, you look like hell.', 'judy');
voice.$on('ended', (e) => { if (e.id === line.id) nextLine(); });
```

| Function | Does |
|---|---|
| `speak(text, voice?, options?)` | Makes the line, or finds it in the cache, and plays it |
| `prepare(text, voice?, options?)` | Makes the line without playing it, so the next one starts sooner |
| `stop(id?, fadeOut?)` | Stops one line, or all |
| `voices()`, `status()` | The names set up, and whether it can speak |

A line can be up to 2,500 characters. Speak a conversation line by line: each line starts sooner. Add `"requires": { "edgewave-voice": ">=0.1" }` to your mod's manifest, so REDnode says when it is missing. The full reference, with the options and the errors, is on EDGEwave's docs: [EDGEwave Voice for REDnode](https://edgemodders.github.io/EDGEwave/rednode-voice.html).
