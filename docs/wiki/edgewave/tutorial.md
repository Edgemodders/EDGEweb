# Tutorial: your first <span class="y">sound mod</span>

In this tutorial you take the sound V's katana makes when it is drawn, make it sound as if it came through a cheap radio, and hear it in the game. You click through it yourself: no coding, no AI, no paid account. It follows the steps of EDGEwave's own test, on the same sound, and that test's result was heard in the game.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Time** | About 20 minutes, half of it the game starting |
| **Before you start** | EDGEwave and [REDcode](../redcode/) are installed, and Game Assets shows its three groups ([Install and set up](install.html)). The game is closed |
| **In the game** | A katana in V's inventory. If you have none, [REDnode](../rednode/install.html)'s Console can give you one, in step 6 |

Three words first. The game plays sounds by **event**: `w_melee_katana_equip` is its name for "V draws a katana". An event can have several recordings, its **variations**, and the game picks one each time. Each recording has a number, its **hash**. In this tutorial you replace one recording. The game's own files are never touched: your version goes into a mod.

## 1. Make a project

A **project** is a folder that holds your mod's files until they are packed into a mod.

1. Open the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and run **REDcode: New Project**.
2. Name it `my_sounds`. Small letters and no spaces keep the game happy.
3. Choose a folder to create it in, anywhere outside the game folder.

| What you should see | |
|---|---|
| VS Code | Opens the new folder |
| REDcode's **Project** view | The project, with **Archive**, **Raw**, **Resources** and **Packed** under it |

Leave the project open. EDGEwave saves into the project REDcode has open.

## 2. Find the sound

1. Click EDGEwave's icon in the activity bar, the strip of icons down the left edge of VS Code.
2. Move the mouse over the **Game Assets** view and press the funnel icon in its title bar (**Filter the Game's Sounds**).
3. Type `katana equip` and press Enter.
4. Under **Sound effects**, find `w_melee_katana_equip`. Move the mouse over it and press **▶** to hear it.
5. Click the small arrow beside its name to unfold it.

| What you should see | |
|---|---|
| After step 3 | A handful of events under **Sound effects**, such as `w_melee_katana_equip` and `w_melee_katana_unequip`. The grey text beside each says how many variations it has |
| After step 4 | You hear the katana being drawn. The status bar at the bottom of VS Code names the recording that played |
| After step 5 | Rows named **Variation 1**, **Variation 2** and so on, each with its hash in grey. On the game version these pages were checked with, there are three, and Variation 1 is `746693166` |

Press **▶** on each variation to hear how they differ.

{% include shot.html caption="The katana's event in Game Assets" shows="EDGEwave's Game Assets view filtered by 'katana equip': the Sound effects group with w_melee_katana_equip unfolded into Variation 1, 2 and 3 with their hashes, and the play, add and open buttons showing on the hovered row." %}

## 3. Open it

Move the mouse over **Variation 1**. Three small buttons appear at the right of the row: **▶**, **+** and a page with an arrow. Press the last one, **Open in EDGEwave**. You can also right-click the row and choose **Open in EDGEwave**.

| What you should see | |
|---|---|
| A new tab | EDGEwave's sound editor. Near the top is the **Mix** bar, with one row under it, the sound's **lane**, labelled `1 · w_melee_katana_equip · 746693166`. Below that is the sound's waveform |
| REDcode's Project view | Under **Raw**, a folder `sfx\w_melee_katana_equip` with a file `746693166.edgewave` |
| EDGEwave's **Sounds** view | The same file, under **Project** |

That file is the **sound document**. It lists your edits and holds no audio.

Press **Space** to hear the sound in the editor. If nothing plays, click the waveform once first.

## 4. Make it a radio

1. Below the waveform are three panes: **Edits**, **Effects** and **Master**. In **Effects**, open the menu that reads **Preset...** and choose **Radio**.
2. Press **Space**.

| What you should see | |
|---|---|
| The Effects pane | Five effects, top to bottom: High-pass, Low-pass, EQ, Distortion, Compressor. Together they make the Radio sound |
| What you hear | The same draw, thin and crunchy, as if from a small speaker |
| The tab | A dot appears on it, VS Code's sign for unsaved changes |

Press `Ctrl+S` to save. Changed your mind? `Ctrl+Z` undoes and `Ctrl+Y` redoes, and the **×** beside an effect removes it. Keep the radio for now: it is what you listen for in the game.

{% include shot.html caption="The Radio preset on the katana sound" shows="The EDGEwave editor on 746693166.edgewave: the Mix bar with Render WAV and Add to Project, one lane, the waveform, and the Effects pane listing the Radio preset's five effects with their values." %}

## 5. Add it to the project

1. Press **Add to Project...**, at the right end of the Mix bar.
2. A list opens, titled "Add to Project: what should the mix replace?". Under the heading `Track 1 · w_melee_katana_equip · 746693166`, choose **Override sound 746693166**.

| What you should see | |
|---|---|
| A message | "Sound 746693166 now overrides the game's, in ...", naming the files it wrote, and how to hear it. It has the buttons **Pack and Install** and **Pack** |
| REDcode's Project view | Under **Archive**, a sound pack (`sfx_container_<number>.opuspak`) and the sound index (`sfx_container.opusinfo`) |

What happened: EDGEwave rendered your radio version, and REDcode wrote it into the project in the game's own sound format. The other rows in the list are other ways into the game: [Into the game](into-the-game.html) explains them.

## 6. Into the game

1. Make sure the game is closed. Press **Pack and Install** in the message. If the message is gone, press **Pack and Install** in REDcode's Project view, the rocket in the view's title bar.
2. Press **Run Game**, the play triangle beside it, and load a save.
3. Put a katana in V's hands, then put it away and draw it again, several times.

No katana? With [REDnode](../rednode/install.html) 0.49.5 or later in the game: press **F10**, click the **REDNODE** tab, switch on **Console**, type this and press Enter. Then equip the katana from the inventory.

```js
addItem("Items.Preset_Katana_Default")
```

| What you should see | |
|---|---|
| After step 1 | REDcode packs the project and installs it. The game folder's `archive\pc\mod` now has `my_sounds.archive` |
| After step 3 | On some draws, your radio version in place of the clean one |

The Console line was not part of EDGEwave's test, which used a katana V already had. The very first time V takes out a weapon that is new to them, the game may play a longer flourish with its own sound: put the katana away and draw it again.

## What to listen for

| Listen for | You should hear |
|---|---|
| The draw, over ten or so tries | Your radio version about one time in three. You replaced one of the event's recordings, and the game picks one each time |
| Everything else | Unchanged: putting the katana away, swings and hits are other events |

| If | Do this |
|---|---|
| Every draw sounds like the original | Check that you started the game after **Pack and Install**: the game reads its sounds once, when it starts. Then see [I hear no change](troubleshooting.html#in-the-game) |
| The list in step 5 has no **Override sound** row | The sound on the track is not a game sound effect. Open the variation from Game Assets again, as in step 3 |
| "Open a REDcode project first" | REDcode has no project open. Open the `my_sounds` folder in VS Code |

## Put it back

Your mod is one small set of files, so taking it out is simple. Close the game. In REDcode's Project view, open the **`...`** menu and choose **Uninstall**. The katana sounds as it did the next time the game starts. Your project stays as it is, and **Pack and Install** puts the mod back. More: [Uninstall](../redcode/pack-install.html#uninstall).

## Try next

- **Every draw, not one in three.** Open Variation 2 and Variation 3 the same way, give each the Radio preset and choose its **Override sound**. Or replace everything the event plays in one go, with **Replace the event ..., every variation, with REDmod**. That route needs one REDcode setting switched on first: see [Replace everything an event plays](into-the-game.html#replace-everything-an-event-plays).
- **Another effect.** Try **PA speaker** or **Muffled through a wall**, or change one effect's values. See [Effects and presets](editing.html#effects-and-presets).
- **Layer a second sound on it.** The **+** in the Mix bar adds another game sound or a file of your own as a second track. See [Tracks](editing.html#tracks).
- **Silence a sound.** **Silence the event** makes the game play nothing for it. On this same katana event that was heard, as silence, in EDGEwave's test.
- **Find out what a sound is called.** Don't know which event you hear in the game? REDnode's [Sound Tracer](../rednode/sound-tools.html#sound-tracer) lists every event as the game plays it.
- **A sound the game doesn't have.** [Voice tools](voices.html) make one from a description, with an ElevenLabs account.
