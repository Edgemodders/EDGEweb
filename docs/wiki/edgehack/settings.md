# Settings and <span class="y">commands</span>

Everything EDGEhack offers, in one place. You don't need to learn it: each button is explained on the page where you use it.

| On this page | |
|---|---|
| [Settings](#settings) | Two, both for Generate |
| [Command palette](#command-palette) | Commands you can run by name |
| [In the views](#in-the-views) | Title-bar buttons and right-click actions |
| [On a quickhack's page](#on-a-quickhacks-page) | Its buttons |
| [Where things are kept](#where-things-are-kept) | Files and folders |

## Settings

Open VS Code's settings (`Ctrl+,`) and search for `edgehack`. Both settings are for **Generate**, which draws icons with OpenAI: see [Generating icons](editor.html#generating-icons-cost-and-your-openai-key).

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `edgehack.generate.model` | Empty | The OpenAI model Generate uses. Empty means the newest GPT Image model your OpenAI account offers |
| `edgehack.generate.quality` | `medium` | The quality Generate asks for: `low`, `medium`, `high` or `auto`. Higher costs more per image |

EDGEhack has no setting for the game folder or the project. It takes both from [REDcode](../redcode/settings.html).

## Command palette

Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` and type `EDGEhack`.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| **EDGEhack: Open a Quickhack...** | Opens a quickhack by its record id, such as `Items.OverheatLvl2Program`. For when you know the id from REDcode or another tool |
| **EDGEhack: Filter** | Narrows the Quickhacks view by words: a name, a category, or part of an id (`overheat`, `control`, `Lvl4`, `camera`) |
| **EDGEhack: Clear the Filter** | Shows every quickhack again. Listed only while a filter is on |
| **EDGEhack: Refresh** | Listed twice. One reads the game's quickhacks again, after a game patch or a mod change. The other reads the Library's folders again |
| **EDGEhack: Clone and Modify on the Desk...** | Starts a new quickhack on the [Desk](desk-library.html#the-desk), from one of the game's |
| **EDGEhack: Connect an Assistant (MCP)...** | Connects Claude Code or another assistant: see [Assistants](assistants.html#connect-claude-code) |
| **EDGEhack: Set the OpenAI Key...** | Saves or changes the key Generate uses |
| **EDGEhack: Clear the OpenAI Key...** | Forgets the key, after asking. Generate asks for it again next time |

EDGEhack sets no keyboard shortcuts. Add your own in VS Code's Keyboard Shortcuts (`Ctrl+K Ctrl+S`).

## Where things are kept

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| A project's quickhacks (their documents) | `source\raw\edgehack\<name>.quickhack.json` in the project |
| Their TweakXL files | `source\resources\r6\tweaks\<mod>\` in the project |
| Their scripts | `source\resources\red4ext\plugins\REDnode\apps\<mod>\` in the project |
| The redscript file for new quickhacks | `source\resources\r6\scripts\EDGEhack\NewQuickhacks.reds` in the project |
| The Desk | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\EDGEhack\desk` |
| The EDGE Library | The folder you chose, `Documents\EDGE Library` by default. Its place is noted in `%APPDATA%\EDGE\library.json`, which every EDGE tool reads |
| What a project took from the Library | `source\library.json` in the project |
| Your OpenAI key | VS Code's secret storage, encrypted, for EDGEhack only. If Windows has an `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable, EDGEhack uses that one |
| The server for assistants | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\EDGEhack\server\edgehack-mcp.cjs`, copied there by the extension |
| The log | **View › Output**, then **EDGEhack** in the list |

Nothing is kept in the game folder until you install a mod.
