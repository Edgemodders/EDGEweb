# <span class="y">Scripts</span>

Scripts are optional. Everything else on a quickhack's page applies to every target alike. A script lets a quickhack treat targets differently: it can decide whether the quickhack may be used on a particular person, and do something extra when it lands on them.

A script is a few lines of JavaScript. You can write them yourself, or ask Claude to: see [Assistants](assistants.html), tool `hack_script`.

| [What it needs](#what-it-needs) | REDnode, for you and for your players |
| [Add one](#add-one) | From the quickhack's page |

## What a script can do

| Function | When it runs | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Scan check**, `canUse(target, hack)` | Each time V scans a person | Answers `true` to show the quickhack as usable on them, or `false` to show it disabled, with a text of yours |
| **On land**, `onLand(target, hack)` | When the quickhack takes effect on a living person, an instant after its normal effects start | Adds to the quickhack: more damage, a status effect, anything worked out from the target. It can't cancel the quickhack |

A script works on a new quickhack and on a change to a game quickhack.

## What it needs

| Need | Why |
|---|---|
| [REDnode](../rednode/install.html) in the game | REDnode runs the script. The version is in [What each feature needs](install.html#what-each-feature-needs) |
| The quickhack in a project | A script can't be added on the Desk or in the Library |
| The mod installed with **Pack and Play** | The script travels with the mod. [Try Live](try-live.html#what-shows-live) does not send scripts |
| The mod's package switched on in the game | The first time, open REDnode's launcher (`F10`), find **`<your mod's name>` quickhacks** in the [Mod Manager](../rednode/mod-manager.html) and switch it on |

Players of your mod need the same: REDnode installed, and the package switched on. Say so on your mod's page.

## Add one

The **Scripts** section is near the bottom of a quickhack's page.

1. Press **Add** on **Scan check** or **On land**.
2. The script file opens beside the page, with the function already written and a comment saying what it gets.
3. Write your lines inside the function, and save the file.
4. Save the quickhack's page too. That writes the helper files REDnode needs.

**You should see** the row's button change from **Add** to **Open**, the script file's path above the table, and the page's status line end with "and the mod's REDnode package".

{% include shot.html src="/assets/shots/edgehack/scripts-section.webp" caption="The Scripts section" shows="The Scripts section of a quickhack's page: the script file's path, Scan check with Open, On land with Add, and the A disabled hack says field." %}

| Control | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Add** | Writes an empty function into the script file, and makes the file if there is none |
| **Open** | Opens the script at that function |
| **A disabled hack says** | With a scan check: the text the quickhack list shows on a person the quickhack is disabled on. Empty, it says "Not on this target" |
| **Remove** | Takes the script off the quickhack. The file stays in your project |

**Which files are yours.** The script file is `source\resources\red4ext\plugins\REDnode\apps\<mod>\<quickhack>.mjs` in your project. EDGEhack never rewrites it. It only adds an empty function when you press **Add**. Three helper files beside it are EDGEhack's, and it writes them again each time you save a quickhack's page, so don't edit those: `main.mjs`, `rednode-app.json` and `quickhacks.d.ts`.

## What a function gets

`target` is the person, as they were when the game asked:

| Field | Holds |
|---|---|
| `level`, `health`, `healthPercent` | Their level, their health in points, and their health in percent (0 to 100) |
| `isHuman`, `isDrone`, `isAndroid`, `isMechanical` | What they are, each `true` or `false` |
| `isBoss`, `isElite`, `isCivilian` | Their rank |
| `damage(amount)` | Lowers their health by that many points, as if V did it |
| `addEffect(effect)` | Puts a status effect on them, as if V did it. It takes the effect's record id, such as `"BaseStatusEffect.ContagionPoisonLvl2"` |

`hack` says which quickhack and tier is being used:

| Field | Holds |
|---|---|
| `tier` | The tier as a number: 1 is Common, 2 Uncommon, 3 Rare, and so on |
| `item` | The record id of the tier's item |
| `action` | The record id of what the tier does. You rarely need it |
| `spread` | In `onLand` only: `true` when the quickhack spread to this person from another target |
| `byV` | In `onLand` only: `true` when V uploaded it |

**Finding an effect's record id.** Add the effect on the page with **Add Effect...**, then click **record** on its card: REDcode opens the record and shows its id. Or ask Claude, whose `hack_effects` tool lists them. Remove the card afterwards if you only wanted the id.

As you type in VS Code, it offers these fields by name.

## Examples

Usable only on people who aren't bosses:

```js
export function canUse(target, hack) {
  return !target.isBoss;
}
```

More damage on the wounded, growing with the tier:

```js
export async function onLand(target, hack) {
  if (target.healthPercent < 50) await target.damage(20 * hack.tier);
}
```

**Keep a scan check quick.** It runs every time V scans someone, so answer from `target` alone. The first time V scans a person, the quickhack shows "Checking..." for about a second while your check runs. If the check doesn't answer, the quickhack shows as it would without a script.

{% include shot.html src="/assets/shots/edgehack/scripts-in-game.webp" caption="A made quickhack in the game" shows="A scanned enemy with Static Bloom, a quickhack made in EDGEhack, ready in the list of available quickhacks, and its Hacking tab showing its damage, duration, upload time and feature lines." %}

Tell players what your script does with a [feature line](editor.html#feature-lines), since the game can't describe it for you.

## Try it

You need a quickhack of your own in a project, such as Static Bloom from [Your first quickhack](first-quickhack.html).

1. On its page, press **Add** on **On land**.
2. In the file that opens, find the line that starts `// if (target.healthPercent < 50)`. Delete the `//` at its start, and save the file.
3. Save the quickhack's page.
4. Close the game, press **Pack and Play**, then start the game and load a save.
5. Press `F10`. In the Mod Manager, switch on **`<your mod's name>` quickhacks**.
6. Shoot an enemy to below half health, then upload your quickhack on them.

| What you should see | |
|---|---|
| After step 3 | The status line ending "and the mod's REDnode package" |
| After step 5 | The package listed and switched on, with no error in REDnode's **Mod log** |
| After step 6 | The enemy taking an extra hit as the quickhack lands |

If nothing extra happens, open REDnode's **Mod log** (`F10`). It shows the mod's own lines and any error in your script. More in [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.html#in-the-game).

Scripts use REDnode's `quickhacks` API. To see the layer underneath, read [More APIs](../rednode/more-apis.html) in REDnode's section.
