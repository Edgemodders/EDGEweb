# EDGEhack with <span class="y">assistants</span>

You can ask an AI assistant to do what EDGEhack's page does: "Make a new quickhack from Overheat called Static Bloom, with 2 more RAM on every tier and Contagion's poison added." The assistant finds the quickhack, makes the change and tells you which file it wrote. It asks you before every change.

It works through EDGEhack's **MCP server**. MCP is the standard that lets an AI assistant use a tool, and the server is the small program that offers EDGEhack's tools to it. You connect it once.

## Which assistant

| Assistant | Today |
|---|---|
| **Claude Code**, Anthropic's assistant for your desktop | Works. You connect EDGEhack yourself, below |
| **[EDGEchat](../edgechat/)**, the EDGE plugin for Claude Code | Does not include EDGEhack yet. Connect EDGEhack as below, and the two work side by side |
| **Agents inside VS Code** (VS Code 1.101 or later) | See EDGEhack's tools with no connecting. Not tested by EDGEhack's developer |
| **Another MCP client** | Can run the server: see [Without VS Code](#without-vs-code) |
| **[REDagent](../redagent/)**, the assistant inside the game | Coming, not released: see [below](#redagent-in-the-game) |

New to Claude Code? Start with [Connect Claude Code](../connect-claude-code.html).

## What an assistant can do

| Tool | What it does | Asks you first |
|---|---|---|
| `hack_find` | Searches the game's quickhacks, and your own in the project, on the Desk and in the Library | No |
| `hack_describe` | Describes a game quickhack's tiers in plain words, or says what one of yours changes | No |
| `hack_effects` | Lists the effects that can be added: status effects, other quickhacks' effects, and what EDGEhack can build | No |
| `hack_new` | Makes a new quickhack from one of the game's, starts a change to a game quickhack, or adds a Desk or Library quickhack to the project | Yes |
| `hack_edit` | Changes a quickhack as the editor's page does: costs, texts, icons, cooldown, effects, Get it, feature lines. It writes the mod files | Yes |
| `hack_script` | Writes a quickhack's [script](scripts.html): its scan check or its on-land function | Yes |
| `hack_pack` | Packs the project. It does not install the mod. Install it with **Pack and Play** in VS Code, or ask Claude to install the project with [EDGEdeck](../edgedeck/) if you use EDGEchat | Yes |
| `hack_try` | [Try Live](try-live.html) in the running game, and Stop. Not yet tested with Claude Code | Yes |

- **It asks.** Claude Code asks you before every call of a tool marked **Yes**, whatever permission mode it is in.
- **It names the file.** Every answer names the quickhack's file. Open it in VS Code to see the change on EDGEhack's page.
- **The Library is yours.** An assistant can take a quickhack from the Library, but it can't add one. You do that yourself in VS Code, because you choose its folders.

{% include shot.html src="/assets/shots/edgehack/assistants-claude.webp" caption="Claude Code changing a quickhack" shows="Claude Code in VS Code, asked to set Static Bloom's duration to 6 on every tier: it reads the quickhack with hack_describe, then asks before running hack_edit, with Yes and No. Static Bloom is open in EDGEhack's editor beside it." %}

## Connect Claude Code

1. In VS Code, open EDGEhack's **Desk** view, click the **`...`** in its title bar, and choose **Connect an Assistant (MCP)...**. The command palette has it too, as **EDGEhack: Connect an Assistant (MCP)...**.
2. Choose **Connect Claude Code**.
3. Start a **new** Claude Code session in your project's folder.
4. Type `/mcp` in Claude Code.

| What you should see | |
|---|---|
| After step 2 | "EDGEhack is connected to Claude Code." |
| After step 4 | `edgehack` in the list, with eight tools |

The connection is made once, for every later Claude Code session. A session that was already running before step 2 doesn't see it: start a new one.

**Which project it works on.** The server works on the project in the folder where you started Claude Code. To work on another, give its folder in your request. With no project, new quickhacks go on EDGEhack's [Desk](desk-library.html).

The other choices in step 2:

| Choice | For |
|---|---|
| **Copy the Claude Code command** | Running the same registration yourself, in a terminal where Claude Code works |
| **Copy a JSON entry** | Another MCP client's settings file |
| **Reveal the server file** | Any client that can run a file with Node 20 or later |

### Without VS Code

The same server is on npm as `@edgemodders/edgehack-mcp`, so it runs with no VS Code and no EDGEhack extension. It needs Node 20 or later. In a terminal:

```
claude mcp add --scope user edgehack -- npx -y @edgemodders/edgehack-mcp
```

Then start a new Claude Code session in your project's folder. Quickhacks made this way open in EDGEhack's editor later, if you install it.

| Option | Sets |
|---|---|
| `--project <folder or .cpmodproj>` | The project to work on |
| `--game <folder>` | The game folder, if it isn't found |
| `--bridge <REDbridge.exe or its folder>` | REDbridge, if it isn't found |

## What the server needs

| Part | Why |
|---|---|
| Cyberpunk 2077, version 2.5 | The server reads the quickhacks from your game. It finds a Steam install, or the game folder REDcode or EDGEdeck is set to |
| [REDbridge](../redbridge/) and .NET 10 | They read the game's files. REDcode fetches both, and so does REDnode's Mod Manager. The server finds the newest copy |
| A project | For mod files. Without one, new quickhacks go on the Desk |
| [REDnode](../rednode/install.html) in the game | Only for `hack_try`, and for scripts to run |

## REDagent in the game

**Coming, not released.** [REDagent](../redagent/) is the assistant inside the game. With EDGEhack's tools it will make a quickhack while you play: the quickhack lands on EDGEhack's Desk, REDagent can try it live and put the tier you asked for in V's backpack, and you add it to a project in VS Code later.

This is built, and passed its test in the game. It needs a REDnode and a REDagent newer than the ones released today, so you can't use it yet. This page will say so when they are out.

{% include shot.html src="/assets/shots/edgehack/assistants-redagent.webp" caption="REDagent making a quickhack" shows="The game with REDagent's window: the player's request for a new quickhack, REDagent's ask card for hack_new, and its answer saying the quickhack is on EDGEhack's Desk." %}

## Try it

With Claude Code connected, start a new session in your project's folder and ask:

> Make a new quickhack from Overheat called Static Bloom, with 2 more RAM on every tier and Contagion's poison added.

| What you should see | |
|---|---|
| Claude Code looks first | It reads Overheat and Contagion's effects without asking |
| Then it asks | Once before making the quickhack, and again before each change |
| Its answer | The name of the file it wrote, ending `static_bloom.quickhack.json` |
| In VS Code | Static Bloom in the Desk view's **Project** group. Click it to see the RAM and the poison on its page |

Then get it into the game with [Pack and Play](try-live.html#pack-and-play).
