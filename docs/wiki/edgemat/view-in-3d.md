# View in <span class="y">3D</span>

The color map in the setup editor shows where each layer goes on a flat texture. **View in 3D** shows the same colors on the garment itself, in [REDcode](../redcode/)'s 3D viewer, where you can turn it around.

EDGEmat doesn't have a viewer of its own: REDcode shows the mesh (the garment's 3D shape), and EDGEmat gives REDcode's viewer the colors. So you need REDcode installed. Its REDbridge starts by itself when VS Code opens.

## How to use it

1. In [Find](find.html), search for a garment and unfold it to a mesh. A mesh on the [Desk](desk.html) works the same way, and shows the Desk's edits.
2. Hover the mesh's row and click the **eye** (or right-click › **View in 3D**).
3. REDcode opens the mesh in a new tab, on its 3D view.
4. **Pick the right look.** A mesh can have several looks (the game's files call them appearances), and REDcode starts on the first one, which is often not yours. The status bar at the bottom of VS Code names the one you came from, for example: *EDGEmat: pick the look "red_yellow_graphic" in the 3D view*. Choose that name in the viewer's **Appearance** list.
5. Drag to turn the model. Switch looks in the Appearance list to compare them.

| What you should see | |
|---|---|
| After step 3 | The garment in 3D, in the colors of the mesh's first look |
| After step 4 | The garment in its layers' colors, and an **approximate** note in the viewer |

Without REDcode installed, the eye says so and offers to show REDcode's extension page.

## What you see, and what you don't yet

| Kind of material | In the 3D view |
|---|---|
| Layered (`.mlsetup`) | Its color map, each layer's color where its mask puts it: the same picture as the setup editor's map, wrapped onto the model |
| Textured, such as decals, logos and stitches | Its own color texture, as in the game |
| Others: glass, hair, skin details, lights | REDcode's own flat color, one plain color per material. That is normal |

The viewer marks EDGEmat's colors **approximate**, because this first version gives **colors only**: no shine, no bumps, no metal, no detail patterns, and no lighting the way the game does it. The full preview with all of that is planned. Dark colors can also look darker here than in the game: see [Surface pages](surfaces.html#colors-on-screen-and-in-the-game).

{% include shot.html caption="The Arasaka jacket in 3D" shows="REDcode's 3D view of t2_078_ma_jacket__samurai.mesh on its default look: a near-black jacket with the Arasaka decals and stitches showing as textures." %}

## Live while you edit

Keep the 3D view open beside the [setup editor](setup-editor.html). While a setup is open, the 3D view shows it as edited, before you save, and follows each change, undo (`Ctrl+Z`) and redo (`Ctrl+Y`) within about a second. Close the editor without saving and the 3D view goes back to the saved setup. After a save, or a [new material](new-material.html) put on the mesh, it draws the materials again by itself.

The live preview only reaches a 3D view opened from the same place as the setup:

| You opened the setup from | Open View in 3D from |
|---|---|
| Find (a game file) | The mesh row in Find |
| A line on the Desk | The eye on that Desk line |
| Your project | The project's copy of the mesh |

A 3D view of the game's mesh, opened from Find or from REDcode's Game Assets, keeps the game's colors. It does not show an edit you made on the Desk.

## Good to know

- The first time a material is shown, EDGEmat makes its picture from the game's files. That takes about a second for a whole jacket. After that it is kept.
- **Show Log** in Game Materials' **`...`** menu lists each request, such as `3D view: 5 of 5 materials for ...t2_078_ma_jacket__samurai.mesh, look default, in 1055 ms`.
- **View in 3D** on a mesh in your project opens the project's copy, and EDGEmat reads your project's copies of its setups and textures first.
- You can go the other way too: **Open in EDGEmat** in the 3D view's toolbar puts the mesh you are looking at on the [Desk](desk.html).
