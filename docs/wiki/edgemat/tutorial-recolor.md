# Tutorial: recolor a <span class="y">jacket</span>

In this tutorial you turn the **Rocker's Heart crystaljock bomber** blue and wear it in the game. You click through it yourself: no coding, no AI, no paid key. These are the steps EDGEmat's own recolor test follows, on the same jacket.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Time** | About 20 minutes, half of it the game starting |
| **Before you start** | EDGEmat and [REDcode](../redcode/) are installed, and Game Materials has built its list ([Install and set up](install.html)). The game is closed |
| **You also need** | [REDnode](../rednode/install.html) 0.49.5 or later in the game. Its Console gives V the jacket in step 7 |
| **Rather ask Claude?** | [Recolor a jacket with EDGEchat](../edgechat/recolor.html) makes the same kind of mod by chat |

Three words first. A garment's color lives in its **setup**, a small file with a stack of **layers**: leather, trim, stitching and so on. Each layer has a **surface** (the kind of stuff) and a color from that surface's own list. You change one layer's color, and EDGEmat saves a changed copy of the setup into your project. The game's own files are never touched.

## 1. Make a project

A **project** is a folder that holds your mod's files until they are packed into a mod.

1. Open the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and run **REDcode: New Project**.
2. Name it `my_materials`. Small letters and no spaces keep the game happy.
3. Choose a folder to create it in, anywhere outside the game folder.

| What you should see | |
|---|---|
| VS Code | Opens the new folder |
| REDcode's **Project** view | The project, with **Archive**, **Raw**, **Resources** and **Packed** under it |

Leave the project open. EDGEmat saves into the project REDcode has open.

## 2. Find the jacket

1. Click EDGEmat's icon in the activity bar, the strip of icons down the left edge of VS Code.
2. Click the **FIND** header, at the bottom of EDGEmat's sidebar, then **Find...** (or the magnifier that shows when you hover the header).
3. Type `rocker's heart` and press Enter.
4. Under **Items**, unfold **Rocker's Heart crystaljock bomber**. Two rows open under it, **Feminine body** and **Masculine body**, each with a mesh (the jacket's 3D shape for that body) and the mesh's materials.
5. Under either body, click the material **black_red_glossy**. It has a stacked-sheets icon and the grey text **multilayered**.

| What you should see | |
|---|---|
| After step 3 | A count line at the top of Find, and the jacket under **Items**. The first search takes a few seconds |
| After step 4 | The meshes `t2_084_pwa__short_sleeves.mesh` (feminine) and `t2_084_pma__short_sleeves.mesh` (masculine) |
| After step 5 | The **setup editor** opens in a tab: a color map on the left and the list of layers on the right. Under the title it says "Select a layer to change it." |

{% include shot.html caption="The bomber in Find" shows="The Find view after searching rocker's heart: the Rocker's Heart crystaljock bomber unfolded into Feminine body and Masculine body, each with its t2_084 mesh and the material black_red_glossy, and the setup editor open beside it." %}

Now find out what the game calls this jacket. Near the top of the setup editor, click the ▸ beside **In the game**. The first time, EDGEmat reads every clothing item, which takes about ten seconds. It then lists the items that wear this look, each with a command and a **Copy** button. For this jacket the command is:

```js
addItem("Items.Jacket_01_old_01")
```

You need it in step 7.

## 3. Pick the biggest layer

Each layer in the list has a bar that shows its **share**: how much of the jacket it covers. The layer with the longest bar decides the jacket's main color.

Click that layer.

| What you should see | |
|---|---|
| In the list | The layer opens. It shows its surface, a **Color** row with a filter box and a grid of color swatches (the current one outlined), and drop-downs for roughness, metal and bumps |
| On the map | Press **Selected layer** under the map: the rest dims and this layer's area lights up. That is the part of the jacket you are about to change |

## 4. Make it blue

1. In the **Color** row, type `blue` in the filter box. The grid narrows to this surface's blues.
2. Click a strong blue swatch.

| What you should see | |
|---|---|
| The layer | Blue in the list and on the map, at once |
| The tab | A dot appears on it, VS Code's sign for unsaved changes. The page says "Edited, not saved yet." |

Changed your mind? Click an empty part of the page, then press `Ctrl+Z` to undo and `Ctrl+Y` to redo. Keep it blue for now: it is what you look for in the game.

{% include shot.html caption="Editing a layer" shows="The setup editor on the Rocker's Heart bomber with its biggest layer selected: the color swatches filtered by 'blue', a blue swatch outlined, the layer blue on the map, and the unsaved dot on the tab." %}

Only the colors this surface offers are in the grid. That is how the game works: see [Colors come from a list](index.html#colors-come-from-a-list).

## 5. Look at it in 3D

Optional. In Find, hover the mesh row `t2_084_...__short_sleeves.mesh` and click the **eye** (**View in 3D**). REDcode opens the jacket in a new tab. The status bar at the bottom of VS Code names the look to pick, **black_red_glossy**: choose it in the viewer's **Appearance** list. Drag to turn the jacket.

The 3D view shows your blue before you save, and follows each further change within about a second. It shows flat colors only, without shine or the game's lighting, so the game will look richer. More: [View in 3D](view-in-3d.html).

## 6. Save it into the project

1. Go back to the setup editor's tab and press **Save to Project**, the button at the top right. `Ctrl+S` does the same.
2. A list opens, titled "Save to Project: my_materials". Choose **As a new setup** (recommended).
3. A box shows the new file's name, ending in `_my_materials.mlsetup`. Press Enter to accept it.
4. EDGEmat looks for the meshes that use this setup, and lists `t2_084_pma__short_sleeves.mesh` and `t2_084_pwa__short_sleeves.mesh`, both ticked. Leave both ticked and press Enter. Two meshes means both body types get the recolor.

| What you should see | |
|---|---|
| A message | "Saved into my_materials: the setup and 2 meshes pointed at it.", with the buttons **Pack and Try** and **Open the Saved Setup** |
| The tab | The unsaved dot is gone, and a line under the title says where the setup was saved |
| REDcode's Project view | Under **Archive**, a folder path ending in `t2_084_jacket__short_sleeves` with the two meshes, and a `textures` folder with your new setup |

What happened: EDGEmat saved your blue setup under a new name, and copied the jacket's two mesh files into the project, changed to use it. That is all the game needs. No helper mod is required.

Don't press **Pack and Try** yet: the next step does it with the game closed.

## 7. Into the game

1. Make sure the game is closed. In REDcode's Project view, press **Pack and Install** (the rocket in the view's title bar).
2. Press **Run Game** (the play triangle beside it), and load a save.
3. Press **F10**, click the **REDNODE** tab and switch on **Console**.
4. Click in the line at the bottom of the Console, type the command from step 2 and press Enter:

   ```js
   addItem("Items.Jacket_01_old_01")
   ```

5. Press **Esc**, open the inventory and equip the jacket.
6. Look at V in photo mode (the **N** key by default), or in a mirror.

| What you should see | |
|---|---|
| After step 1 | REDcode packs the project and installs it. The file `my_materials.archive` is now in the game's `archive\pc\mod` folder |
| After step 4 | The Console answers `1 × Items.Jacket_01_old_01 added` |
| After step 6 | The jacket on V, with its biggest area in your blue |

{% include shot.html caption="The result: the bomber in blue" shows="V in photo mode wearing the Rocker's Heart crystaljock bomber, its main panels blue where they were black and red, the trim and other layers unchanged." %}

## What to look for

| Look at | You should see |
|---|---|
| The big panels | Your blue. Under the game's lighting it looks a little different from the swatch |
| The other layers | Trim, stitching and prints as they were: you changed one layer |
| V's arms in first person | Blue sleeves too |

| If | Do this |
|---|---|
| The jacket still has the game's colors | Check that you equipped the jacket the command gave you, not another bomber. Then see [If you don't see your change](in-the-game.html#3-if-you-dont-see-your-change) |
| The Console isn't in the launcher | It needs REDnode 0.49.5 or later: [update REDnode](../rednode/install.html#updating-rednode) |
| Save to Project found no mesh, or only one | See [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.html#saving-into-a-project) |

## Put it back

Your mod is one file, so taking it out is simple. In REDcode's Project view, open the **`...`** menu and choose **Uninstall**. The jacket has the game's colors again the next time the game starts. Your project stays as it is, and **Pack and Install** puts the mod back. More: [Uninstall](../redcode/pack-install.html#uninstall).

## Try next

- **Another color, or another layer.** Open the saved setup: in REDcode's Project view, right-click the new `.mlsetup` file and choose **Open Material in EDGEmat...**. Change it and press `Ctrl+S`: it now saves straight into the project, with no questions. Then Pack and Install again.
- **Another surface.** In a layer's **Surface** row, **Change...** swaps leather for denim, chrome or anything else in the game. See [Changing a layer](setup-editor.html#changing-a-layer).
- **Several versions side by side.** Put a garment on [the Desk](desk.html) and try two colors before you choose one.
- **Stay in the game while you work.** With REDnode, REDcode can swap each new version in without a restart: [Keep the game running](in-the-game.html#keep-the-game-running).
- **A material the game doesn't have.** [Tutorial: worn leather](tutorial-worn-leather.html) makes one from a line of words.
