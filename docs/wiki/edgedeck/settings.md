# Settings and <span class="y">commands</span>

A reference page. Most people never change a setting: EDGEdeck finds what it needs on its own.

| On this page | |
|---|---|
| [Settings](#settings) | All nine |
| [Commands](#commands) | [Everyday](#everyday), [a single mod](#a-single-mod), [Nexus Mods](#nexus-mods), [setup and maintenance](#setup-and-maintenance) |
| [Buttons on the EDGEdeck page only](#buttons-on-the-edgedeck-page-only) | Not in the command palette |

## Settings

Open the editor's settings (`Ctrl+,`) and type `edgedeck` in the search box.

{% include shot.html caption="EDGEdeck in VS Code's settings" shows="VS Code's Settings editor filtered to edgedeck, showing the game path, library path and Nexus settings." %}

| Setting | Default | What it does | Change it when |
|---|---|---|---|
| `edgedeck.gamePath` | empty | The Cyberpunk 2077 folder (the one with `bin`, `archive` and `r6`). Empty means find it through Steam, GOG or Epic on every start | The game is somewhere those launchers can't see. **Pick the game folder...** sets it for you |
| `edgedeck.launch` | `auto` | How **Run game** starts the game: `auto` (through Steam for a Steam install, else the game's program file), `steam` (always through Steam) or `exe` (always `bin\x64\Cyberpunk2077.exe`). Every way adds `-modded`, which REDmod mods need | Run game starts the game the wrong way for your setup |
| `edgedeck.libraryPath` | empty | Where your mods are kept: every mod in the list, on or off. Empty means `%USERPROFILE%\EDGEdeck` | Don't change it by hand: that only points EDGEdeck at another folder. Use **Move library...**, which moves the mods and sets this for you |
| `edgedeck.bridgePath` | empty | Path to `REDbridge.exe` or its folder. Empty means the copy **Get REDbridge** fetched, else a REDbridge checkout next to EDGEdeck's, else REDbridge on your PATH | You build REDbridge yourself |
| `edgedeck.dotnetRoot` | empty | Where REDbridge, and only REDbridge, looks for .NET. Empty means the .NET 10 that Get REDbridge installed for your Windows user, else whatever the PC has | Rarely. See the warning below |
| `edgedeck.nexusCheckUpdatesOnStart` | on | Asks Nexus once a day whether your mods have newer files. Needs a Nexus sign-in | You don't want daily update checks |
| `edgedeck.nexusClientId` | empty | The id Nexus will assign to EDGEdeck for signing in through the browser. Not assigned yet | Only when told to in EDGEdeck's release notes |
| `edgedeck.nexusApplication` | empty | The application name for Nexus's older browser sign-in, used when there's no client id | Only when told to in EDGEdeck's release notes |
| `edgedeck.vortexStagingPath` | empty | Where Vortex keeps its Cyberpunk mods, for **Import from Vortex**. Empty means EDGEdeck looks in the usual places and asks when it finds none | Vortex keeps its mods somewhere unusual. Import sets it for you when it asks |

> **Never set `DOTNET_ROOT` for your whole Windows account.** Every .NET program then looks only there, and it breaks other tools, Vortex among them. If REDbridge needs a different .NET, use `edgedeck.dotnetRoot`, which applies to REDbridge alone.

## Commands

Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the command palette and type `EDGEdeck` to see them. Most are also buttons in the Mods view or on the EDGEdeck page.

Commands that act on one mod aren't in the command palette. They are on the mod's row and in its right-click menu. Names ending in `...` ask you something before they act.

### Everyday

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| Open EDGEdeck | Opens the wide EDGEdeck page |
| Add mod | Adds a mod from a zip, 7z or rar, a single mod file such as an `.archive`, or a folder |
| Deploy | Makes the game folder match your list. Waits until the game is closed |
| Run game | Deploys any waiting changes, then starts the game with `-modded`. Leaves a running game alone |
| Update all | Gets the newest file for every mod with an update waiting, after one question. Reads **Update shown** on the EDGEdeck page while a search or filter narrows the list |
| Undo deploy | Removes everything EDGEdeck deployed. Waits until the game is closed |
| Show pending changes | Lists what the next deploy will do, and why |
| Show conflicts | Opens the Conflicts page |
| Refresh | Reads the library and the game folder again |
| Hide mods that are off, Show all mods | The eye in the Mods view's title bar. Shows only the mods that are on, or all of them again |

### A single mod

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| Details | Opens the mod's detail panel |
| Deploy this mod | Turns the mod on and puts only its files in the game. Other changes keep waiting |

| Reveal in Game Folder | Shows where the mod, folder or file sits in the game folder, in File Explorer |
| Rename... | A name of your own for the mod in EDGEdeck (also **F2** on its row). Files and the game don't change |

### Nexus Mods

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| Nexus: sign in | Opens your Nexus API Access page and asks for your personal API key. Shown as **Nexus sign in** in menus and **Sign in to Nexus Mods** among the Set up steps. See [Signing in](nexus.html#signing-in) |
| Nexus: set API key (paste, instead of signing in) | Asks for the key without opening the browser |
| Nexus: sign out | Removes the key from EDGEdeck |

| Open library folder | Opens the library in File Explorer |
